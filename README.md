# Columbia Street

A five-channel jungle sequencer for the Miyoo Mini Plus running OnionOS.

Four break channels play slices of sampled drum breaks: the Amen and other loops, chopped at their
hits. The fifth channel is a bass: a sub, a Reese, an 808, an FM growl, or one of 20 jungle bass
samples, played through a short riff. Each channel is sequenced by three polymetric Euclidean
cells:

- **HIT** plays a slice.
- **ROLL** ratchets it: snare rolls, ×2 up to ×8 in one step.
- **ALT** varies it: reverse, an octave up or down, the next slice, a random slice, or a stop.

Every break channel has its own pitch, a filter, a **bit depth from 1 to 24 bits**, sample-rate
reduction and a **compressor**. On the bus are a glue compressor, drive, a reverb, a
tempo-synced L2 filter sweep, and punch-in repeat, reverse and tape-stop effects. Eight
pattern slots switch on the bar line, and the unit syncs tempo over Wi-Fi with HI5 and
Jaffedrone, or leads other gear from a mono + clock-pulse output.

## Install

1. Build it (see below), or download `ColumbiaStreet-miyoo.zip` from the latest release, or
   from the artifacts of the latest run on the Actions tab.
2. Unzip at the root of the OnionOS SD card, so the app lands in `SD:/App/ColumbiaStreet`. With
   the card mounted you can also run `make install SD=/run/media/$USER/<card>`.
3. Launch **Columbia Street** from Apps. Press MENU to quit.

The state autosaves to `columbia.sav` in the app folder.

## The breaks

`make` fetches a curated set into `dist/ColumbiaStreet/breaks` and `bass` from TidalCycles'
[Dirt-Samples](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Dirt-Samples), pinned to one commit, with
`tools/fetch_samples.sh`:

| Bank | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| AMEN | The Amen break, 3 bars at 153 BPM, cut at its 28 hits |
| AMENCU | The Amen pre-chopped into 32 slices |
| PLEAD, RAWCLN, SDSTCK, BLLSTP | Four more breaks, 125-165 BPM |
| JUNGLE | A jungle hit kit: kicks, snares, hats, ride, crash, percussion |
| bass/ | 20 jungle subs and basses for the BASS channel |

The recordings are not committed to this repo. They keep their original rights: the Amen comes
from The Winstons' "Amen, Brother", and Dirt-Samples does not state a licence for these folders.
The release zip includes them, so check that this is acceptable to you before publishing
one.

### Your own breaks

Drop any break into `App/ColumbiaStreet/breaks/` (Apache, Think, Funky Drummer...). A `.wav`
file is a loop, sliced at its hits. Put the tempo in its name (`APACHE_115bpm.wav`) and the
slices land on the 16th grid; without a tempo, it is guessed from the length. A folder of
`.wav` files is a pre-chopped break, one slice per file in name order. Bass one-shots go in
`bass/`; their pitch is detected on load. See the README.txt in each folder.

## Controls

These work on every page:

| Button | Action |
| --- | --- |
| L1 / R1 | Previous / next page |
| START | Play / stop |
| SELECT | A new jungle beat on all five channels; R2+SELECT undoes it |
| L2 (hold) | Low-pass sweep, closing over the time set on MIX > MASTER > L2 |
| R2 + up / right | Repeat the last 1/8 / 1/16 |
| R2 + left / down | Reverse / tape stop |
| R2 + X | Tap tempo (taps under 100 BPM count double) |
| MENU | Quit |

The pages are PATTERN, CHOP, BASS, MIX and SONG. The footer shows each page's keys.

- **PATTERN**: a 5 × 3 grid of cells, one row per channel. The d-pad picks a cell. A turns it
  on or off, X / Y add or remove hits. Hold B and press up / down to change the length (1-32
  steps), or left / right to rotate. A tap of B rolls a random Euclidean rhythm.
- **CHOP**: one break channel at a time (left / right). The waveform shows the bank's slices,
  the ones this channel can pick, and the slice playing. Up / down picks a parameter, X / Y
  change it, A plays the slice, B mutes the channel.
  - **BREAK, SLICE**: the bank, and the slice to play.
  - **MODE**: FIX plays SLICE every hit. WALK steps through RANGE slices from SLICE, one per
    hit. RAND picks one of them at random. GRID plays the slice that falls on this step of the
    break, so a full HIT cell plays the break straight and a thinner one drops hits out.
  - **PITCH** in semitones. **FIT** speeds the break up or slows it down to the tempo, as
    jungle does.
  - **LENGTH** cuts the slice short. **ROLL** is the ratchet count, **ALT** what the ALT cell
    does.
  - **FILTER**: left of OPEN is a low-pass, right a high-pass.
  - **BITS**: 24 down to 1. **RATE**: sample-rate reduction down to 1.5 kHz.
  - **COMP**: 0 is off; higher lowers the threshold and raises the ratio together (to -36 dB
    and 8:1, 2 ms attack), with make-up gain. The bar under it shows the gain reduction.
- **BASS**: WAVE, ROOT, OCTAVE and a RIFF (a short note pattern; each hit plays the next note,
  restarting every two bars). LENGTH is the note length in 16ths, or HOLD. Also GLIDE, CUTOFF,
  RESO, WIDTH (Reese detune, growl wobble, sub warmth), DRIVE, ROLL and ALT (octave up, fifth,
  octave down, slide, rest).
- **MIX**: a column per channel (LEVEL, PAN, SEND to the reverb) and the master (LEVEL, GLUE
  compressor, DRIVE, VERB time, TONE, and the L2 sweep time). A mutes, B solos.
- **SONG**: pattern slots A-H. A loads a slot (at the next bar while playing), X saves the
  pattern into it, R2+Y clears it. Below them are the tempo, the Wi-Fi sync mode and the
  output row (OUTPUT, CLOCK ON, PPQN, PULSE): left / right picks a setting, X / Y changes it.

## Wi-Fi sync

Columbia Street speaks HI5S, the sync protocol of HI5 and Jaffedrone. Units on the same network
share tempo, bar phase and transport over UDP broadcast on port 5150. Set the mode on the SONG
page: OFF, AUTO, LEAD or FOLLOW. A unit set to LEAD wins; otherwise the lowest id leads.
OnionOS Wi-Fi must be on.

## Clock out (mono + clock)

As on HI5, the SONG page's **OUTPUT** switches between STEREO and **MONO+CLK**: the sound in mono
on one side of the headphone jack and clock pulses on the other, for a Pocket Operator, Volca or
other gear with a sync input (split it with a stereo-to-two-mono cable). **CLOCK ON** picks the
side (RIGHT by default), **PPQN** the pulses per quarter note (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 or 32: 2 for
Pocket Operators and Volcas, the default; 24 for DIN sync) and **PULSE** the width (1-20 ms, 5 by
default). The pulses run only while the sequencer plays and follow tap tempo and Wi-Fi sync. In
mono + clock every channel plays from the centre: the PANs read C on the MIX page and come back
with STEREO. Songs saved by v0.1 load in STEREO.

## Building

You need [zig](https://ziglang.org/) 0.14 for the cross-compile; the Makefile looks in
`~/.local/opt/zig-aarch64-linux-0.14.1/zig`, or set `ZIG=...` (`pip install ziglang==0.14.1`
also provides it). You also need `curl`, `python3` (with Pillow for the icon), and for `make
test` a host C compiler and ImageMagick.

```sh
make              # cross-compile dist/ColumbiaStreet/columbia and fetch the samples
make test         # host harness: screenshots, audio and engine checks into build/test
make zip          # package dist/ColumbiaStreet as build/ColumbiaStreet.zip
make install SD=/path/to/mounted/sdcard
make package CROSS=/opt/miyoomini-toolchain/usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-   # OnionOS gcc, as CI does
```

### Releases

CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) builds the Miyoo package and runs the tests on every push.
To publish a release with `ColumbiaStreet-miyoo.zip` attached, push a version tag (`git tag
v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0`), or run the workflow from the Actions tab with a tag in
`release_tag`. Releases are marked as test builds and use `.github/release-notes.md` as their
notes; running again for the same tag replaces the zip.

The build links against Onion's own MI_AO/MI_GFX-backed SDL 1.2, which `make` downloads into
`third_party/onion-lib/` (not committed).
